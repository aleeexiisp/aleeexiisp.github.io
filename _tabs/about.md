The desire to learn, to grow both mentally and physically and to leave the world in a better way in which I found it are the pillars and essence that causes me to remain firm and present in my goals. My current and main area of expertise pertain to Cybersecurity and red teaming exercises. I decided to start my path with Cyber due to the increasing threats appearing due to the world digitalisation. My main goal is to establish proper technical knowledge to be able to assess the security architecture of organisations and provide the better solutions for the latest security concerns.
