## 1. What is Hacking ?

There is a general misconception about the term "Hacker". This concept is often confused with cyber criminals who use the same technical knowledge as hackers for financial gain or other negative purposes. The term Hacker can have multiple meanings, for example this is what Oxford say a Hacker is: 

> A hacker is a person who uses computers to gain unauthorized access to data. [Oxford]

In my opinion this is a clear example of the misconception I stated before. Why unauthorised access to data ? In the real world, a Hacker is a person that actually needs authorisation before testing anything. 

My own conception or meaning of a Hacker is the following:

A Hacker is a person (or nowadays an AI) who runs specialized techniques against a system or infrastructure to properly understand the risks they are exposed to. This is done under an explicit authorisation and working ethically with the only objective of helping organisation protect for future threats.



Although there are many cybersecurity specializations, this post will mostly focus on the Penetration Test and exploitation side of it.
