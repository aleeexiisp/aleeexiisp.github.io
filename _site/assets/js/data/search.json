    "content": "What is Process Injection  As described by MITRE, process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the processâ€™s memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.In other words, process injection is a technique commonly used by attackers to inject a malicious shellcode or payload inside the memory space of a running process. The type of payload we can run ranges from executing a random application such as calc.exe to a reverse shell."
